Run "GUI_execute.py" and fill out the input variables.

PGA: Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) represents the maximum ground acceleration during an earthquake event.

PGV: Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) represents the maximum ground velocity during an earthquake event.

PGD: Peak Ground Displacement (PGD) represents the maximum ground displacement during an earthquake event.

W: Weight of the superstructure. The mass of the superstructure is considered to be between 3600 tons and 14400 tons.

Teff or Tb: Isolator period, representing the effective or natural period of the isolator system.

Tp: Pulse period of the ground motions, indicating the duration of the seismic pulse.

uy: Yielding displacement, representing the displacement at which the isolator starts yielding.

DD: Design displacement, indicating the desired or target displacement for the structure under seismic loading.

Q: Characteristic strength of the isolator, representing the maximum strength of the isolator material.
